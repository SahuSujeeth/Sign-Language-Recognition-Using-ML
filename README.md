🤟 Sign Language Recognition using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time Sign Language Recognition system that detects hand gestures using a webcam and converts them into readable text and speech. It helps bridge the communication gap between normal people and the hearing/speech impaired community.

The system uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and Machine Learning (Random Forest) for gesture classification.

📸 Dataset Collection

👉 Step 1: Run data collection script

python collect_data.py

👉 Step 2: Enter label

Example:

A

👉 Step 3: Show your hand gesture in front of camera

- Images will be captured automatically
- Around 300–500 images per class are recommended

📂 Dataset Location

All collected images are stored in:

dataset/<label>/

Example:

dataset/A/
dataset/B/

---

🧹 Dataset Preparation

- Ensure images are clear and properly captured
- Maintain consistent lighting and background
- Avoid blurry or incorrect gestures

---

🏋️ Model Training

👉 Run training script

python train_model.py

🔍 What happens:

- Loads dataset
- Extracts hand landmarks using MediaPipe
- Trains Random Forest model
- Saves model files:

gesture_model.pkl
label_encoder.pkl

---

🎯 Prediction (Real-Time Detection)

👉 Run prediction

streamlit run app.py

(or)

python predict_live.py

🔍 What happens:

- Opens webcam
- Detects hand using MediaPipe
- Predicts gesture using trained model
- Displays output on screen
- Converts text → speech
